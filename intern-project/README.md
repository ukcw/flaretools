# Getting Started with the Zone Viewer

Head to https://intern-project.ulysseskee.software.\
Enter your @cloudflare email in the input box and click 'Send me a code'.\
Enter the code and you're into the site!\
Go to the `Zone Viewer` by clicking `Zone Viewer` on the top left of the screen.\
Enter your `Zone ID` and `API Token` in their respective fields.\
If you have not obtained an API Token and/or Zone ID yet, the guides are below at `Getting your API Token` and `Getting your Zone ID`.\
If you do face any bugs, or have any suggestions for improvements and added functionality, please report them to ulysses@cloudflare.com.\
Thank you and happy viewing!

## Getting your API Token

Login to the Cloudflare Dashboard at https://dash.cloudflare.com and go to `User Profile` -> `API Tokens` or click this link https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens.\
Click `Create Token`.\
Use the `Read all resources` template by clicking `Use template` on the right of `Read all resources`.\
Adjust the duration of the token lifespan if required.\
Click `Continue to summary` and `Create Token`. Save this API Token somewhere safe. You now have your API Token to use!

## Getting your Zone ID

Under `Overview`, scroll down on the page and you should see your `Zone ID` on the right hand side of the page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
