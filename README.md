### Overview
This project consists of a two different parts:
1. The UI is built using React and the Chakra-UI library on a Cloudflare Worker.
2. The REST API server is built using the *itty-router* library on a different Cloudflare Worker.

### What this tool is useful for
Primarily, this tool has been built to help any user of Cloudflare to gain a better overview of their zone configuration settings across different zones,
and also allow them to compare and do copying of configuration settings easily. The current site is live at https://flaretools.cloudflareuniversity.com
and you are able to try it out there if you are a current user of Cloudflare.
